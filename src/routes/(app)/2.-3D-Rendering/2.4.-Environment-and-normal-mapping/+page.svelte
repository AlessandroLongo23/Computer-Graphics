    <p>The purpose of this set of exercises is to become familiar with the concepts behind environment mapping and normal mapping.</p>
    <p>We will use environment mapping to render a curved reflector and, in the process, learn how to use cube maps and the reflection function. We will also use normal mapping to add scale-like surface details.</p>
