    <p>This last page is dedicated to the final project of the course, which consists in the following:</p>
    <p>Collect texture assets from <a href="https://polyhaven.com/textures">Poly Haven</a> with layers such as diffuse, displacement, normal, roughness, ambient occlusion, and use these layers to render a sphere (and perhaps another object as well) with a high level of detail.</p>
