    <p>Interactive computer graphics enables us to manipulate digital 3D objects. The ability to work interactively with digital objects is an important engineering skill.</p>
    
    <p>Our objective in this course is to enable the participants to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>implement real-time computer graphics systems</li>
        <li>to develop graphics algorithms with applications in visualization, modelling, and animation.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The course covers web graphics technology and introduces the principles of 3D graphics that one would need for working on CAD systems, game engines, computer animation, 3D multimedia, virtual reality, and scientific visualization.</p>
